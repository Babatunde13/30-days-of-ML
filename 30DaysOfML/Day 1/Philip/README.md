# What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. Machine-learning algorithms use statistics to find patterns in massive amounts of data.

There are perhaps 14 types of learning that you must be familiar with as a machine learning practitioner; they are:

## Learning Problems

    1. Supervised Learning
    2. Unsupervised Learning
    3. Reinforcement Learning

## Hybrid Learning Problems

    4. Semi-Supervised Learning
    5. Self-Supervised Learning
    6. Multi-Instance Learning

## Statistical Inference

    7. Inductive Learning
    8. Deductive Inference
    9. Transductive Learning

## Learning Techniques

    10. Multi-Task Learning
    11. Active Learning
    12. Online Learning
    13. Transfer Learning
    14. Ensemble Learning
